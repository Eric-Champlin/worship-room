## Design System & Component Architecture
 
This file is the comprehensive design reference for UI implementation. It covers the color palette, typography, component inventory, custom hooks, utility libraries, canonical visual patterns (Round 3 + Daily Hub Round 3 + Bible wave additions), and feature-specific architecture.
 
### Color Palette
 
- **Primary**: `#6D28D9` (deep violet) — Tailwind: `primary`
- **Primary Light**: `#8B5CF6` (lighter violet accent) — Tailwind: `primary-lt`
- **Hero Dark**: `#0D0620` (dark purple for hero gradient) — Tailwind: `hero-dark`
- **Hero Mid**: `#1E0B3E` — Tailwind: `hero-mid`
- **Hero Deep**: `#251248` — Tailwind: `hero-deep`
- **Hero BG**: `#08051A` (darkest background, used by homepage and Daily Hub root) — Tailwind: `hero-bg`
- **Glow Cyan**: `#00D4FF` (legacy cyan token, no longer used on Daily Hub textareas — see "Textarea Glow Pattern" below) — Tailwind: `glow-cyan`
- **Neutral Background**: `#F5F5F5` (warm off-white) — Tailwind: `neutral-bg`
- **White**: `#FFFFFF`
- **Text Dark**: `#2C3E50` (dark gray-blue) — Tailwind: `text-dark`
- **Text Light**: `#7F8C8D` (medium gray) — Tailwind: `text-light`
- **Success**: `#27AE60` (green for positive moods) — Tailwind: `success`
- **Warning**: `#F39C12` (orange for neutral moods) — Tailwind: `warning`
- **Danger**: `#E74C3C` (red for negative moods/flags) — Tailwind: `danger`
- **Borders**: `#2a2040` — Tailwind: `dark-border`, `#9CA3AF` — Tailwind: `muted-gray`, `#6B7280` — Tailwind: `subtle-gray`
 
### Mood Color Palette
 
Used for check-in orbs, chart dots, heatmap squares, and data visualization accents:
 
| Mood       | Value | Color               | Hex       |
| ---------- | ----- | ------------------- | --------- |
| Struggling | 1     | Deep warm amber     | `#D97706` |
| Heavy      | 2     | Muted copper/orange | `#C2703E` |
| Okay       | 3     | Neutral gray-purple | `#8B7FA8` |
| Good       | 4     | Soft teal           | `#2DD4BF` |
| Thriving   | 5     | Vibrant green-gold  | `#34D399` |
 
### Bible Reader Themes (BibleReader chrome only)
 
The Bible reader supports three reader-only theme variants that apply to the `ReaderChrome` and reading surface only. These do NOT affect the rest of the app — the navbar, footer, and other pages remain on the canonical dark theme regardless of the reader theme selection. Stored in `wr_bible_reader_theme`.
 
| Theme       | Background          | Text                | Use case                                   |
| ----------- | ------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `midnight`  | Deep dark (default) | White-on-dark       | Default; matches the rest of the app      |
| `parchment` | Warm cream          | Dark brown          | High contrast for sustained reading        |
| `sepia`     | Aged paper tone     | Muted dark sepia    | Reduced eye strain in low-light environments |
 
The reader also exposes per-user controls for type size (`s`/`m`/`l`/`xl`), line height (`compact`/`normal`/`relaxed`), and font family (`serif`/`sans`). All four preferences persist to localStorage. See `11-local-storage-keys.md` for the exact keys.
 
### Dashboard Card Pattern
 
Frosted glass cards for the all-dark dashboard:
 
- `bg-white/5 backdrop-blur-sm border border-white/10 rounded-2xl`
- Padding: `p-4 md:p-6`
- Collapsible with height transition (`overflow-hidden`)
 
**Homepage and Daily Hub cards** use the upgraded `FrostedCard` component (see "Round 3 Visual Patterns" section below) which has stronger borders, box-shadow, hover states, and a tier system for content prioritization.
 
### Text Opacity Standards
 
**Homepage, Daily Hub, and landing page sections (Round 3 standard):** Default to `text-white` for all readable text. Reserve muted opacities only for lock overlays (`text-white/50`), placeholder text (`placeholder:text-white/50`), and purely decorative elements (`text-white/20` to `text-white/40`). StatsBar ALL CAPS labels use `text-white/90`.
 
**Daily Hub body text readability standard (post Spec T):** Reading-heavy content (devotional reflection body, devotional question, journal prompts) uses `text-white` with `leading-[1.75]` to `leading-[1.8]`, font sizing `text-[17px] sm:text-lg`, and `max-w-2xl` line length. Italic styling has been removed from prose body text (Lora italic was too taxing for sustained reading).
 
**Dashboard and other inner pages (WCAG AA standard):** All text on dark backgrounds must meet these minimum opacity values:
 
| Use Case                         | Minimum | Class                              |
| -------------------------------- | ------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Primary text                     | 70%     | `text-white/70`                    |
| Secondary text                   | 60%     | `text-white/60`                    |
| Placeholder text                 | 50%     | `placeholder:text-white/50`        |
| Large headings (18px+)           | 60%     | `text-white/60`                    |
| Interactive text (buttons/links) | 50%     | `text-white/50`                    |
| Decorative / disabled            | 20-40%  | `text-white/20` to `text-white/40` |
 
Body text below `text-white/60` fails WCAG AA 4.5:1 on hero-dark (#0D0620).
Placeholder text below `placeholder:text-white/50` fails WCAG AA 3:1 on input backgrounds.
 
**Exempt from contrast requirements:** decorative icons, locked badge silhouettes, verse number superscripts, middot separators, disabled/locked state indicators, background decorations.
 
**Note:** The homepage and Daily Hub use `text-white` for all readable text (which exceeds WCAG AA). When redesigning inner pages to match the homepage style, prefer `text-white` everywhere. The WCAG minimum table above is a floor, not a target.
 
### Typography
 
- **Body Font**: Inter (sans-serif) — Tailwind: `font-sans`
  - Regular: 400, Medium: 500, Semi-bold: 600, Bold: 700
- **Scripture Font**: Lora (serif) — Tailwind: `font-serif`
  - Regular: 400, Italic: 400 italic, Bold: 700
  - **Use case:** Scripture passage rendering (devotional passage, Bible reader, scripture soaking). NOT used for prose body text or journal prompts.
- **Decorative Font**: Caveat (cursive) — Tailwind: `font-script`
  - Used for branding elements (logo) only.
  - **Deprecated for headings.** Homepage and Daily Hub headings use `GRADIENT_TEXT_STYLE` (white-to-purple gradient via `background-clip: text`) instead. Caveat has been fully removed from Daily Hub. Other inner pages should be migrated to gradient text in future redesigns.
- **Heading Font**: Inter (same as body for consistency)
  - Semi-bold: 600, Bold: 700
- **Font Sizes**: Hero: 3rem (mobile: 2rem), H1: 2.5rem (1.75rem), H2: 2rem (1.5rem), H3: 1.5rem (1.25rem), Body: 1rem, Small: 0.875rem
 
### Breakpoints
 
- **Mobile**: < 640px (sm)
- **Tablet**: 640px - 1024px (sm to lg)
- **Desktop**: > 1024px (lg+)

## Animation Tokens (BB-33 — canonical)
 
All animations site-wide use canonical duration and easing tokens from `frontend/src/constants/animation.ts`. Do NOT hardcode `200ms` or `cubic-bezier(...)` strings in new components — import from the tokens module instead. The tokens were introduced in BB-33 and 194 files were migrated to use them during the Bible wave polish cluster.
 
### Duration tokens
 
| Token     | Value | Use case                                                                 |
| --------- | ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `instant` | 100ms | Press feedback, immediate state changes (button active, toggle flip)     |
| `fast`    | 200ms | Hover states, tooltip reveals, dropdown open/close, micro-interactions   |
| `base`    | 300ms | Modal open/close, drawer slide, tab transitions, panel expand/collapse   |
| `slow`    | 500ms | Page transitions, celebration sequences, decorative fade-ins             |
 
### Easing tokens
 
| Token         | Value                              | Use case                                                  |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `standard`    | `cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1)`     | Default for most transitions (Material standard easing)   |
| `decelerate`  | `cubic-bezier(0, 0, 0.2, 1)`       | Elements entering the screen (drawers sliding in)         |
| `accelerate`  | `cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 1, 1)`       | Elements leaving the screen (drawers sliding out)         |
| `sharp`       | `cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.6, 1)`     | Toggles, switches, attention-grabbing micro-interactions  |
 
### Spring easings — REMOVED
 
Spring easings (`cubic-bezier(0.34, 1.56, 0.64, 1)` and similar) were removed from modals, toasts, and drawers in BB-33. They felt too playful for emotionally vulnerable moments. Use `standard`, `decelerate`, or `accelerate` instead. Spring easings are still acceptable on celebration overlays and confetti animations where the bounce serves the emotional moment.
 
### Button press feedback
 
Approximately 30 CTAs across the app use `active:scale-[0.98]` for press feedback. This is the canonical micro-interaction for tappable buttons. Apply to any new primary CTA.
 
### Custom Tailwind animations (still in use)
 
These are layered on top of the token system for specific named animations:
 
- `animate-cursor-blink` (1s) — typewriter input cursor
- `animate-dropdown-in` (150ms, uses `decelerate`) — navbar dropdown fade + slide up
- `animate-slide-from-right`, `animate-slide-from-left` (300ms, uses `decelerate`) — tab transitions
- `animate-golden-glow` (2s) — golden box-shadow for completion celebration
- `animate-breathe-expand`, `animate-breathe-contract` (4s, 8s) — meditation breathing
- `animate-fade-in` (500ms, uses `decelerate`) — general fade + slide up
- `animate-confetti-fall` — CSS-only confetti for celebration overlays
- `animate-drawer-slide-in` — AudioDrawer right-side flyout slide-in (uses `decelerate`)
- `animate-bottom-sheet-slide-in` — AudioDrawer mobile bottom-sheet slide-up (uses `decelerate`)
 
### Removed animations
 
- ~~`animate-glow-pulse`~~ — **REMOVED in Wave 6.** Previously animated cyan/violet glow on textareas. Replaced with static white box-shadow per Daily Hub Round 3 (see "Textarea Glow Pattern" below). The keyframe and animation registration have been removed from `tailwind.config.js`.
 
---
 
## Reduced-Motion Safety Net (BB-33)
 
A global `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` rule lives in `frontend/src/styles/animations.css` and disables all animations site-wide when the user has reduced motion enabled. This is the canonical reduced-motion handling — individual components do NOT need to check `prefers-reduced-motion` themselves.
 
```css
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  *, *::before, *::after {
    animation-duration: 0.01ms !important;
    animation-iteration-count: 1 !important;
    transition-duration: 0.01ms !important;
    scroll-behavior: auto !important;
  }
}
```
 
### Documented exemptions
 
Three classes of animation are exempt from the reduced-motion rule because the animation IS the feature:
 
1. **Shimmer animations (300ms)** — Skeleton loading shimmer is decorative-without-urgency. The shimmer is gentle and conveys loading state more clearly than a static gray box. Exempted via specific selector overrides.
2. **Breathing exercise (`/meditate/breathing`)** — The breath-along animation is the entire feature. Removing it would break the meditation. Exempted via component-level inline animation that does not use the global rule.
3. **Garden ambient SVG animations** — The growth garden's gentle sun/cloud movement is part of the visual metaphor. Removing it would make the garden feel dead. Exempted via SVG-level animation attributes.
 
When adding new animations, default to using the global rule (do nothing — the animation will be auto-disabled). Only exempt an animation if removing it would meaningfully break the feature, and document the exemption in this file.
 
---
 
## Textarea Glow Pattern (Daily Hub Round 3)
 
The Pray and Journal textareas use a **static white box-shadow** instead of an animated glow. The previous `animate-glow-pulse` was removed because the pulsing motion competed with the user's focus during emotionally vulnerable writing.
 
**Canonical class string for textarea glow:**
 
```
shadow-[0_0_20px_3px_rgba(255,255,255,0.50),0_0_40px_8px_rgba(255,255,255,0.30)]
border border-white/30
focus:border-white/60 focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-white/30
```
 
**Apply to:** PrayerInput textarea, JournalInput textarea. Other textareas (Bible search, AskPage, Reading Plan create flow) may continue using their existing glow treatment or be migrated to this pattern.
 
---
 
## Shared Components
 
### Layout Components
 
- **Layout.tsx** — Wrapper: `<Navbar>` + content + `<SiteFooter>`. Passes `transparent` prop on landing page.
- **Navbar.tsx** — Glassmorphic navigation. Desktop: 5 top-level items + Local Support dropdown + avatar dropdown. Mobile: hamburger drawer (`MobileDrawer`). `transparent` prop controls absolute vs relative positioning. Logged-in state: replaces Log In/Get Started with notification bell + avatar dropdown (see `10-ux-flows.md` for nav structure). The navbar mounts the canonical skip-to-main-content link.
- **SiteFooter.tsx** — Dark purple footer. Nav columns (Daily, Music, Support), crisis resources, app download badges (Coming Soon), "Listen on Spotify" badge, BB-35 accessibility statement link, copyright.
- ~~**PageTransition.tsx**~~ — **REMOVED.** Previously did 150ms opacity fade-out + 200ms fade-in on route changes. Removed in Wave 2 because it caused a route flicker/white flash. The `html`, `body`, and `#root` backgrounds remain set to `#08051A` in `src/index.css` to prevent any white flash during navigation.
 
### Layout Exception: BibleReader
 
**The BibleReader is a documented layout exception.** It does NOT use `Layout.tsx`, `Navbar.tsx`, or `SiteFooter.tsx`. Instead it uses a dedicated `ReaderChrome` component that provides:
 
- A reader-specific top bar with theme/typography/font controls, the chapter selector, the back button, and the AI Explain/Reflect entry points
- A reader-specific bottom toolbar with audio controls, the bookmarks/notes/highlights drawer trigger, and the verse number toggle
- A focus mode that dims the chrome after a configurable idle delay (`wr_bible_focus_delay`, default 6 seconds)
- An immersive reading surface with no navbar and no footer
 
The BibleReader has its own root-level skip-to-main-content link because the canonical Navbar skip link is not present. When auditing pages, treat the BibleReader's structure as documented intentional drift. Do NOT flag it as "missing footer" or "missing navbar" — those are intentional design decisions for the immersive reading experience.
 
The reader's settings drawer also includes BB-41's notification permission entry point (the contextual prompt that fires after a reading session) and BB-39's PWA install affordance when the user is on a supporting browser.
 
### Design System Components
 
- **PageHero.tsx** — Purple gradient header with title, subtitle, optional `HeadingDivider`. Used by Prayer Wall, Local Support pages.
- **HeadingDivider.tsx** — White decorative SVG divider with fade gradients. Responsive via `useElementWidth()`.
- **BackgroundSquiggle.tsx** — Decorative SVG squiggle (viewBox 1800×1350, 6 paths). Exported `SQUIGGLE_MASK_STYLE` for consistent fade mask. **Currently used only by the homepage `JourneySection`** as a narrow inline SVG (~150px column, centered, `preserveAspectRatio="none"`). **NOT used on Daily Hub** — squiggles were removed from all Daily Hub tabs in Wave 5 because they competed with the new HorizonGlow atmospheric layer.
- **SongPickSection.tsx** — Centered single-column layout: "Today's" (GRADIENT_TEXT_STYLE) + "Song Pick" (white) heading stacked vertically with equal-width treatment via tracking adjustment, Spotify 352px iframe centered below, `max-w-2xl` container. No glass card wrapper, no music icon, no HeadingDivider. No GlowBackground (transparent — sits over the Daily Hub HorizonGlow layer).
- **HeroSection.tsx** — Landing page hero: dark purple gradient, typewriter input, quiz teaser link. UNTOUCHED by homepage redesign.
- **JourneySection.tsx** — 7-step vertical timeline with numbered circles, gradient keyword text, inline narrow squiggle SVG, glow orbs. Steps link to feature routes.
- **StartingPointQuiz.tsx** — 5-question quiz inside a frosted glass container (`rounded-3xl`), gradient progress bar. `id="quiz"` for scroll target. Only appears on the landing page (removed from Daily Hub in Round 3 redesign).
- **TypewriterInput.tsx** — Hero input with typewriter placeholder animation.
- **SpotifyBadge.tsx** — "Listen on Spotify" badge link.
- **Breadcrumb.tsx** — Breadcrumb navigation for detail pages.
- **FeatureEmptyState.tsx** — Reusable warm empty state with icon, heading, description. Used in 10+ locations. Standardized as the canonical empty state primitive in BB-34. Any new empty state should use this component.
- **FirstRunWelcome.tsx** (BB-34) — Single-screen welcome card for brand-new visitors. Shows 3-4 "start here" options as tappable cards (Bible reader, Daily Hub, Prayer Wall, Music). Dismissible via X button or any card click. **Triggered only on home/Dashboard for visitors with no `wr_first_run_completed` value set. NEVER appears on deep-linked routes** — a user landing on `/bible/john/3?verse=16` from a shared link bypasses the welcome entirely. The welcome is never a gate; it's an informational layer.
- **FormField.tsx** — Accessible form field with `aria-invalid`, `aria-describedby`, character count, inline validation (built but not yet adopted by production forms).
 
### Homepage Components (`components/homepage/`)
 
> These patterns apply to the homepage. **Daily Hub uses a different background architecture (HorizonGlow at the page level instead of per-section GlowBackground).** See "Daily Hub Visual Architecture" section below for the Daily Hub-specific patterns.
 
Shared building blocks for the landing page, created during the Round 3 homepage redesign (HP-1 through HP-15):
 
- **SectionHeading.tsx** — 2-line heading: smaller white `topLine` + larger purple gradient `bottomLine`. Backward-compatible single `heading` prop. See "Round 3 Visual Patterns" for sizing.
- **GlowBackground.tsx** — Atmospheric glow wrapper with variants: `center`, `left`, `right`, `split`, `none`. Glow orb opacity at 0.25-0.50 range. Includes `glowOpacityMultiplier` prop (added in Spec T) for per-instance opacity scaling. **Currently used by:** homepage sections only. **NOT used by Daily Hub** (replaced by HorizonGlow).
- **FrostedCard.tsx** — Glass card: `bg-white/[0.06] backdrop-blur-sm border border-white/[0.12] rounded-2xl` with dual box-shadow. Optional `onClick` adds hover elevation. Used by both homepage and Daily Hub. See "FrostedCard Tier System" below for content tier guidance.
- **StatsBar.tsx** — 6 animated counters (scroll-triggered via `useAnimatedCounter`). 50 Devotionals, 10 Reading Plans, 24 Ambient Sounds, 6 Meditation Types, 5 Seasonal Challenges, 8 Worship Playlists.
- **DashboardPreview.tsx** — "See How You're Growing" section with 6 locked preview cards + "Create a Free Account" CTA.
- **DashboardPreviewCard.tsx** — Locked preview card: blurred mockup on top, clear icon + title + description below. Each icon has a unique accent color.
- **DifferentiatorSection.tsx** — "Built for Your Heart" section with 6 competitive advantage cards.
- **FinalCTA.tsx** — Bottom CTA: "Your Healing Starts Here", "Get Started — It's Free" button → auth modal. Uses `GlowBackground` with `variant="none"` — no glow orb (removed in 585f186 to let the white button shadow carry the emotional peak).
- **dashboard-preview-data.ts** — Card metadata (icons, titles, descriptions, preview keys).
- **differentiator-data.ts** — 6 differentiator cards (titles, descriptions, icons).
- **index.ts** — Barrel export for all homepage components.
 
### Daily Experience Components (`components/daily/`)
 
- **PrayTabContent.tsx** — Pray tab content. Plain `<div>` wrapper with `mx-auto max-w-2xl px-4 py-10 sm:py-14` (no GlowBackground, no BackgroundSquiggle — these were removed in Spec Y). Renders `PrayerInput`, crisis banner, mock prayer generation, `KaraokeText`, action buttons, `GuidedPrayerSection`, cross-tab CTAs.
- **JournalTabContent.tsx** — Journal tab content. Plain `<div>` wrapper with same padding pattern. Renders `JournalInput` (Guided/Free Write toggle, prompt card, draft auto-save, crisis banner, saved entries, AI reflection). No GlowBackground, no BackgroundSquiggle.
- **MeditateTabContent.tsx** — Meditate tab content. Plain `<div>` wrapper. Renders 6 auth-gated FrostedCard meditation cards, completion checkmarks, all-6-complete celebration banner, and the Spec Z verse banner when arriving from devotional with verse params. No heading. No GlowBackground, no BackgroundSquiggle.
- **DevotionalTabContent.tsx** — Devotional tab content. Plain `<div>` wrapper. No heading. Renders date navigation, devotional title, passage (Tier 2 scripture callout), reflection body (Tier 1 FrostedCard), saint quote (Tier 1 FrostedCard, positioned BELOW reflection body per Wave 5), reflection question card with embedded "Journal about this question" CTA (Spec O), authentic Pray flow CTA (Spec P). No GlowBackground (replaced by Daily Hub HorizonGlow). Theme tags removed (Wave 5).
- **PrayerInput.tsx** — Pray tab textarea with 3 starter chips, `rows={8} min-h-[200px] max-h-[500px] resize-y`, white textarea glow, draft auto-save (1s debounce, `wr_prayer_draft` key), draft saved indicator, "Help Me Pray" white pill button matching homepage primary CTA style.
- **JournalInput.tsx** — Journal tab input with mode toggle (Guided/Free Write), prompt card (Inter sans, NOT italic, white text, leading-relaxed), draft auto-save (`wr_journal_draft` key), white textarea glow, "Save Entry" button matching homepage primary CTA. Mounts `DevotionalPreviewPanel` at the top when arriving from devotional context.
- **DevotionalPreviewPanel.tsx** (Spec X) — Sticky collapsible inline preview panel. Pinned at `top-2 z-30` so it follows the user as they scroll. Collapsed state: small pill showing "TODAY'S DEVOTIONAL" label + title + reference + chevron. Expanded state: smooth max-height animation (300ms `decelerate`) revealing the passage, reflection question (callout), reflection body, and quote with internal scroll capped at `max-h-[50vh]`. Includes an `X` close button next to the chevron (Wave 6) for dismissing the panel. Mounted in JournalInput AND PrayerInput when `prayContext?.from === 'devotional' && devotionalSnapshot && !contextDismissed`.
- **DailyAmbientPillFAB.tsx** (Wave 7) — Sticky bottom-right floating action button wrapping `AmbientSoundPill`. Mounted on the DailyHub root only (not on meditation activity sub-pages, which have their own transport controls). Auto-hides when `state.drawerOpen === true` (chat-widget pattern). Uses `pointer-events-none` outer + `pointer-events-auto` inner so empty space around the pill remains clickable. Includes `env(safe-area-inset-*)` for iOS notch / Android nav bar respect.
- **HorizonGlow.tsx** (Spec Y) — Daily Hub-only atmospheric glow layer. Renders 5 large soft purple/lavender glow blobs at strategic vertical percentages (5%, 15%, 35%, 60%, 85%) of the page body. Each glow is `position: absolute` with percentage `top`/`left`, large `width`/`height` (300-900px), heavy `filter: blur(100-120px)`, and centered via `transform: translate(-50%, -50%)`. **Final tuned opacity values (low intensity for readability):** Glow 1: 0.32, Glow 2: 0.28, Glow 3: 0.35, Glow 4: 0.30, Glow 5: 0.28. Mounted on the DailyHub root. **Do not use on other pages** without explicit reconsideration — the layer is scoped to the Daily Hub controlled experience.
- **AmbientSoundPill.tsx** — Pill-shaped button showing current ambient sound state. **Both idle and active states open the AudioDrawer right-side flyout** (Wave 7 unified the behavior — previously idle state used an inline expanding dropdown). When clicked, dispatches `OPEN_DRAWER` / `CLOSE_DRAWER` to AudioProvider. Used inside `DailyAmbientPillFAB` on the Daily Hub.
- **GuidedPrayerSection.tsx** — Pray tab section displaying 8 guided prayer sessions (5/10/15 min). Cards use `min-h-[260px]` (Wave 6) with no `line-clamp` on descriptions so full session descriptions render. 4-column × 2-row grid on desktop, 2-column on tablet, horizontal carousel with snap on mobile.
- **GuidedPrayerPlayer.tsx** — Audio-guided prayer playback UI with TTS narration and silence intervals.
- **MiniHubCards.tsx** — Small cards linking to Pray/Journal/Meditate with completion badges.
- **ReadAloudButton.tsx** — TTS playback via browser Speech Synthesis API.
- **KaraokeText.tsx** — Word-by-word highlighting during Read Aloud and prayer generation.
- **ShareButton.tsx** — Web Share API with fallback dropdown.
- **CompletionScreen.tsx** — Meditation completion celebration with CTAs and MiniHubCards.
- **CrisisBanner.tsx** — Crisis keyword detection + resource alert banner with `role="alert"`.
- **PrayerResponse.tsx** — Generated prayer display with KaraokeText, ambient auto-play, copy/share/save actions.
 
### Audio Components (`components/audio/`)
 
- **AudioDrawer.tsx** — Right-side flyout sidebar (desktop, `lg:right-0 lg:w-[400px] lg:h-full`) / bottom sheet (mobile, `70vh`, swipe-down to dismiss). Dark frosted glass background `rgba(15, 10, 30, 0.95)` with `backdrop-blur(16px)`. Focus trap when open, click-outside dismiss on desktop, Escape key handling via focus trap. Contains `DrawerNowPlaying`, `RoutineStepper`, `DrawerTabs` (ambient browser, sleep browse, etc.). **Always mounted** inside `AudioProvider`, gated by `state.drawerOpen` internally. Opened by both AmbientSoundPill states (Wave 7 unified).
- **AudioPill.tsx** — Now-playing pill (different from AmbientSoundPill) shown when audio is active.
- Other components: `DrawerNowPlaying`, `DrawerTabs`, `AmbientBrowser`, `SleepBrowse`, `RoutineStepper`.
 
### Bible Reader Components (`components/bible/`)
 
The BibleReader was rebuilt during the Bible wave (BB-0 through BB-29) and extended throughout the polish cluster (BB-30 through BB-46). The component inventory below reflects the post-wave state.
 
- **BibleReader.tsx** — The main reader component. Hosts `ReaderChrome`, the verse rendering surface, the focus mode timer, the highlights/notes/bookmarks drawer, the AI Explain/Reflect panels, and the BB-41 contextual notification permission prompt. Reads from `wr_bible_reader_*` preference keys for theme/typography. Subscribes to the chapter visit store on mount (BB-43) so the heatmap reflects today's reading.
- **ReaderChrome.tsx** — Top and bottom toolbars for the reader. Replaces `Navbar` and `SiteFooter` for the BibleReader page. Top bar: theme switcher, type size, line height, font family, focus mode toggle, back button, chapter selector, AI Explain button, AI Reflect button. Bottom bar: audio controls, drawer trigger, verse number toggle. Toolbars dim after `wr_bible_focus_delay` ms of inactivity when focus mode is enabled.
- **BibleBrowser.tsx** — The 66-book browser at `/bible`. Hosts the OT/NT testament tabs (`wr_bible_books_tab`), the book grid, the recent chapters list, the BB-42 search mode, and the Resume Reading card.
- **BibleSearchMode.tsx** — Full-text search UI (BB-42). Wired into BibleBrowser via the `?mode=search` query param. Loads the pre-built inverted index on demand, renders results with verse text, supports keyboard navigation, links each result to the verse via BB-38 deep link contract.
- **MyBible.tsx** (`/bible/my`) — Personal layer page. From top to bottom: the BB-43 reading heatmap, the BB-43 Bible progress map, the BB-45 memorization deck, the unified activity feed (highlights, notes, bookmarks, journal entries). Reads from highlight, bookmark, note, journal, chapter visit, and memorization stores. Subscribes to each via inline `subscribe()` or standalone hook — **does NOT use local `useState` snapshots without subscription** (BB-45 anti-pattern).
- **ReadingHeatmap.tsx** (BB-43) — GitHub-contribution-style heatmap showing daily reading activity for the past 365 days. Each cell is a day; color intensity represents number of chapters read. Hover/tap shows the date and references. Subscribes to `chapterVisitStore` via inline `subscribe()`. Anti-pressure tone — sparse activity is treated as valid.
- **BibleProgressMap.tsx** (BB-43) — Visual map of all 66 books showing read/partially read/unread chapters. Tap a chapter cell to navigate to that chapter via BB-38 deep link.
- **MemorizationDeck.tsx** (BB-45) — Flip-card memorization grid on My Bible. Cards have a front (reference) and back (verse text). Tap to flip. No quiz, no scoring, no spaced repetition. Reads from `useMemorizationStore()`. Add cards via the BibleReader verse menu.
- **EchoCard.tsx** (BB-46) — Single-card display of a verse the user has engaged with in the past. Shows context ("30 days ago you highlighted this") + verse reference + verse text. Tappable, navigates to the verse via BB-38 deep link. Mounted on the home page and Daily Hub. Selection driven by the echo engine at `frontend/src/lib/echoes/`.
- **ExplainPanel.tsx** (BB-30) — AI-generated passage explanation. Triggered from the BibleReader top bar. Calls Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite via the BB-32 cache layer. Anti-pressure voice — explanations are short and explicitly not authoritative.
- **ReflectPanel.tsx** (BB-31) — AI-generated personal reflection prompts for any verse range. Same model and cache as ExplainPanel. Reflections are first-person prompts, not interpretations.
- **NotificationPermissionPrompt.tsx** (BB-41) — Contextual non-modal card that appears at the bottom of the BibleReader after the user completes a reading session. Asks "Want a daily verse to keep this rhythm going?" with Enable / Maybe later buttons. Fires at most once per user (tracked via `wr_notification_prompt_dismissed`). Only fires on the second reading session of the day, not the first.
- **HighlightStore, BookmarkStore, NoteStore, JournalStore, ChapterVisitStore, MemorizationStore, EchoStore** — Reactive store modules at `frontend/src/lib/<feature>/store.ts`. Each exposes a custom hook that internally subscribes via `useSyncExternalStore`. Components consuming these stores **must use the hook**, never `useState(getAll*())`. See `11-local-storage-keys.md` § "Reactive Store Consumption" for the BB-45 anti-pattern.

### Bible Reactive Store Hooks & Subscription (BB-7 through BB-45)
 
Bible-wave stores use two subscription patterns. **Components consuming these stores MUST subscribe** — never call `getAllX()` and store the result in local `useState` without a `subscribe()` call. See `11-local-storage-keys.md` § "Reactive Store Consumption" for the full pattern documentation and the BB-45 anti-pattern.
 
**Standalone hooks (Pattern A — `useSyncExternalStore`):**
- **useMemorizationStore()** (BB-45) — Returns the current array of memorization cards. Hook at `hooks/bible/useMemorizationStore.ts`.
- **useStreakStore()** (BB-17) — Returns `{ streak, atRisk }`. Hook at `hooks/bible/useStreakStore.ts`.
 
**Inline subscription stores (Pattern B — `subscribe()` + `useState` + `useEffect`):**
- **highlightStore** (BB-7) — `lib/bible/highlightStore.ts`. API: `getHighlightsForChapter()`, `applyHighlight()`, `subscribe()`.
- **bookmarkStore** (BB-7) — `lib/bible/bookmarkStore.ts`. API: `getBookmarksForChapter()`, `toggleBookmark()`, `subscribe()`.
- **noteStore** (BB-8) — `lib/bible/notes/store.ts`. API: `getNotesForChapter()`, `upsertNote()`, `subscribe()`.
- **journalStore** (BB-11b) — `lib/bible/journalStore.ts`. API: `getAllJournalEntries()`, `createJournalEntry()`, `subscribe()`.
- **chapterVisitStore** (BB-43) — `lib/heatmap/chapterVisitStore.ts`. API: `getAllVisits()`, `recordChapterVisit()`, `subscribe()`.
- **plansStore** (BB-21) — `lib/bible/plansStore.ts`. API: `getPlansState()`, `markDayComplete()`, `subscribe()`.
 
### Dashboard & Growth Hooks
 
- **useFaithPoints()** — Core gamification hook. Returns `{ totalPoints, currentLevel, levelName, pointsToNextLevel, todayActivities, todayPoints, todayMultiplier, currentStreak, longestStreak, recordActivity(type) }`. Manages `wr_daily_activities`, `wr_faith_points`, `wr_streak` in localStorage.
- **useMoodChartData(days)** — Returns mood entries for the last N days from `wr_mood_entries`. Used by dashboard widget (7 days) and `/insights` page (30/90/180/365 days).
- **useToast()** — Toast system with celebration types (confetti, shimmer). Returns `{ show(message, options), dismiss(id) }`.
- **useGettingStarted()** — Getting started checklist state and progress tracking.
- **useStreakRepair()** — Grace-based streak repair (1 free/week, 50 pts for additional).

---
 
## Storage Service & localStorage Keys
 
`StorageService` interface with `LocalStorageService` in `services/storage-service.ts`. Most keys prefixed `wr_`. Bible redesign personal-layer stores use `bible:` prefix. AI cache uses `bb32-v1:` prefix. See `11-localstorage-keys.md` for the complete inventory with types, descriptions, and reactive store hook references.
 
All writes auth-gated. Abstraction designed for API swap in Phase 3+.
 
### Draft Persistence Pattern (Spec J + V)
 
The Pray and Journal textareas auto-save user content to localStorage with a 1-second debounce. Pattern:
 
- **Keys:** `wr_prayer_draft`, `wr_journal_draft`
- **Debounce:** 1 second after last keystroke
- **UI feedback:** "Draft saved" indicator with `CheckCircle2` icon, fades after 2s
- **Restore:** On component mount, read from localStorage and pre-populate textarea
- **Clear:** When user successfully submits OR explicitly discards
- **Auth flow:** When logged-out user hits the auth wall, AuthModal subtitle reads "Your draft is safe — we'll bring it back after" — draft persists across the auth modal interaction so users don't lose their work
 
This pattern is canonical for any feature where users invest emotional/time effort into content before hitting an auth or submit gate.
 
### Reactive Store Pattern (BB-7 onward)
 
Bible-wave personal-layer features use reactive stores instead of plain CRUD services. Two subscription patterns coexist: standalone hooks via `useSyncExternalStore` (memorization, streak) and inline `useState` + `subscribe()` (highlights, bookmarks, notes, journals, chapter visits, plans). Both patterns are correct. **Storing a snapshot in `useState` without calling the store's `subscribe()` function is the BB-45 anti-pattern and ships as a silent correctness bug.** See `11-local-storage-keys.md` § "Reactive Store Consumption" for the full pattern documentation.

## Music Feature — Technical Architecture
 
### Audio Provider & Context System
 
Global `AudioProvider` wraps the app (between `AuthModalProvider` and `Routes` in `App.tsx`). Exposes 4 contexts:
 
- `AudioStateContext` — read-only state via `useAudioState()`
- `AudioDispatchContext` — actions via `useAudioDispatch()`
- `AudioEngineContext` — Web Audio API service via `useAudioEngine()`
- `SleepTimerControlsContext` — timer controls via `useSleepTimerControls()`
 
**AudioState** includes: `activeSounds`, `masterVolume`, `isPlaying`, `pillVisible`, `drawerOpen`, `currentSceneName`, `foregroundContent`, `sleepTimer`, `activeRoutine`.
 
`AudioEngineService` manages a single `AudioContext` (suspend/resume, never destroy/recreate). Ambient: `AudioBufferSourceNode` with crossfade looping (double-buffer, 1.5s overlap). Foreground: `<audio>` elements via `MediaElementAudioSourceNode`. Smart fade: `linearRampToValueAtTime`.
 
### Visual Theme
 
Music tabs: dark `#0f0a1e` (`bg-dashboard-dark`) background with frosted glass cards (`bg-white/[0.06] border border-white/10 rounded-xl`) and white text. AudioDrawer/AudioPill/overlays: dark-themed (`rgba(15,10,30,0.85)` with white text). Consistent with the rest of the dark-theme app.
 
Hooks kept for potential re-enable: `useSpotifyAutoPause` (commented-out import in `WorshipPlaylistsTab.tsx`). All other previously listed music re-enable components (`TimeOfDaySection`, `PersonalizationSection`, `RecentlyAddedSection`, `ResumePrompt`, `MusicHint`, `LofiCrossReference`, `AmbientSearchBar`, `AmbientFilterBar`) and hooks (`useMusicHints`, `useTimeOfDayRecommendations`) have been deleted from the codebase.
 
### Key Audio Components
 
Audio components in `components/audio/`: `AudioPill`, `AudioDrawer` (right-side flyout / mobile bottom sheet), `DrawerNowPlaying`, `DrawerTabs`, `AmbientBrowser`, `SleepBrowse`, `RoutineStepper`.
 
### Key Audio Hooks
 
In `hooks/`: `useSoundToggle`, `useScenePlayer`, `useForegroundPlayer`, `useSleepTimer`, `useRoutinePlayer`, `useAmbientSearch`, `useAnnounce`.
 
### Audio Constants
 
In `constants/audio.ts`: `MAX_SIMULTANEOUS_SOUNDS: 6`, `DEFAULT_SOUND_VOLUME: 0.6`, `MASTER_VOLUME: 0.8`, `SCENE_CROSSFADE_MS: 3000`, `SOUND_FADE_IN_MS: 1000`, `SOUND_FADE_OUT_MS: 1000`, `LOAD_RETRY_MAX: 3`, `LOAD_RETRY_DELAYS_MS: [1000, 2000, 4000]`, `SLEEP_TIMER_OPTIONS: [15, 30, 45, 60, 90]`, `FADE_DURATION_OPTIONS: [5, 10, 15, 30]`.
 
### Audio Files
 
Placeholder silent MP3s in `public/audio/` (gitignored). Subdirectories: `ambient/`, `scripture/`, `stories/`, `artwork/`. Real TTS via Google Cloud TTS WaveNet (Male: en-US-Wavenet-D, Female: en-US-Wavenet-F). CDN: Cloudflare R2, base URL in `VITE_AUDIO_BASE_URL`.

## Round 3 Visual Patterns (Homepage + Daily Hub)
 
These patterns were established during the GitHub-inspired homepage redesign (HP-1 through HP-15) and the Daily Hub Round 3 redesign (Specs 1-Z). They apply site-wide when building or redesigning pages with dark backgrounds — though the Daily Hub uses its own background architecture (HorizonGlow) instead of per-section GlowBackground.
 
### Section Heading — 2-Line Treatment
 
Use `SectionHeading` component from `src/components/homepage/SectionHeading.tsx`:
 
- **Top line:** `text-2xl sm:text-3xl lg:text-4xl font-bold text-white leading-tight`
- **Bottom line:** `text-4xl sm:text-5xl lg:text-6xl font-bold leading-tight` with `WHITE_PURPLE_GRADIENT` via `background-clip: text` and `text-transparent`
- Size ratio: bottom line is ~1.5x larger than top line
- `mt-1` between lines (tight coupling)
- Props: `topLine`, `bottomLine`, `tagline?`, `align?`
 
### Glow Backgrounds — Homepage Only
 
Radial glow orbs positioned behind content. Used by homepage sections via `GlowBackground` component. **Daily Hub does NOT use this** — see "Daily Hub Visual Architecture" below.
 
**Opacity ranges (center of radial gradient):**
 
- Standard sections: `0.25-0.35`
- Behind card grids: `0.35-0.40`
- CTA / emotional peaks: `0.45-0.50`
- **NEVER use `0.03-0.15`** — invisible on `bg-hero-bg`
 
**Implementation pattern:**
 
```
background: radial-gradient(circle, rgba(139,92,246, CENTER) 0%, rgba(139,92,246, MID) 40%, transparent 70%)
width: 400-900px, height: 300-600px
filter: blur(60-80px)
pointer-events: none, z-0 (content at z-10)
```
 
Two-stop gradient (center → mid → transparent) produces a richer glow pool than single-stop.
 
**Mobile:** Reduce orb size by 40% and blur by 25% below `md` breakpoint. Use `will-change: transform` for GPU compositing.
 
**`glowOpacityMultiplier` prop:** Added in Spec T. Allows per-instance opacity scaling for content that needs more readability protection. Multiplies all orb opacities in the chosen variant. Currently used by: nothing on Daily Hub (Daily Hub no longer uses GlowBackground), available for future homepage use.
 
### Daily Hub Visual Architecture (Spec Y + Wave 7)
 
The Daily Hub uses a different background architecture than the homepage. Instead of per-section `GlowBackground` orbs, the entire Daily Hub root has:
 
1. **Single root background:** `bg-hero-bg` on the DailyHub root div, with `relative min-h-screen overflow-hidden` so atmospheric layers can be positioned absolutely without affecting content layout
2. **HorizonGlow layer:** `<HorizonGlow />` mounted as a direct child of the root, before all content. Renders 5 large soft purple/lavender glow blobs at strategic vertical positions (5%, 15%, 35%, 60%, 85%) of the page body, creating a "looking out into space" atmospheric effect. Final tuned opacity values: 0.32 / 0.28 / 0.35 / 0.30 / 0.28 (low intensity to preserve text readability).
3. **Transparent tab content:** All tab content components (DevotionalTabContent, PrayTabContent, JournalTabContent, MeditateTabContent) and SongPickSection use plain `<div>` wrappers with `mx-auto max-w-2xl px-4 py-10 sm:py-14` — no `bg-*`, no GlowBackground wrapper. The HorizonGlow shows through.
4. **Content z-index:** All content sections (hero, tab bar, tab panels, Song Pick) get `relative z-10` so they sit above the HorizonGlow layer.
5. **DailyAmbientPillFAB:** Sticky bottom-right floating button mounted as the last child of the DailyHub root.
 
**StarField was experimented with but removed.** A Spec Y component called `StarField.tsx` (110+ small white dots scattered across the page) was built and tested, but the visual effect read as "dust on screen" rather than "stars in space." It has been deleted. Do not re-add stars without explicit reconsideration.
 
**Other pages remain untouched.** GlowBackground.tsx still exists and is used by the homepage. The HorizonGlow pattern is scoped to the Daily Hub only.
 
### Frosted Glass Cards (FrostedCard Component)
 
`FrostedCard` component (`src/components/homepage/FrostedCard.tsx`):
 
- Background: `bg-white/[0.06]` with `backdrop-blur-sm`
- Border: `border border-white/[0.12]` — visible, not invisible
- Shadow: `shadow-[0_0_25px_rgba(139,92,246,0.06),0_4px_20px_rgba(0,0,0,0.3)]`
- Radius: `rounded-2xl`, Padding: `p-6`
- Hover (when interactive): `bg-white/[0.09] border-white/[0.18]` with intensified shadows
 
#### FrostedCard Tier System (Spec T)
 
The Daily Hub devotional uses a content tier system to prioritize reading-heavy elements:
 
- **Tier 1 (primary reading content):** Standard FrostedCard with `text-white`, `leading-[1.75]` to `leading-[1.8]`, font sizing `text-[17px] sm:text-lg`. Used for: reflection body, saint quote, reflection question. Italic styling removed for readability.
- **Tier 2 (scripture callout):** `rounded-xl border-l-4 border-l-primary/60 bg-white/[0.04] px-4 py-3` — a left-border accent treatment for the devotional passage. Lighter than a full FrostedCard but still distinct from body prose.
 
This tier system is canonical for any future feature with mixed content density (reading content + accent callouts).
 
### White Pill CTA Patterns
 
Two distinct white pill button patterns:
 
**1. Inline CTA (smaller, used inside cards or content blocks):**
 
```
inline-flex min-h-[44px] items-center gap-2 rounded-full bg-white px-6 py-2.5 text-sm font-semibold text-primary hover:bg-gray-100
```
 
Used by: "Journal about this question", "Pray about today's reading", "Meditate on this passage" — all the inline cross-feature CTAs in the devotional.
 
**2. Homepage primary CTA (larger, used as a section's main action):**
 
```
inline-flex min-h-[44px] items-center gap-2 rounded-full bg-white px-8 py-3.5 text-base font-semibold text-hero-bg shadow-[0_0_30px_rgba(255,255,255,0.20)] transition-all duration-200 hover:bg-white/90 hover:shadow-[0_0_40px_rgba(255,255,255,0.30)] sm:text-lg focus-visible:outline-none focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-white/50 focus-visible:ring-offset-2 focus-visible:ring-offset-hero-bg
```
 
Used by: "Get Started — It's Free" on FinalCTA, "Help Me Pray" on PrayerInput, "Save Entry" on JournalInput, "Generate" buttons on AI flows. The white drop shadow carries the emotional weight of the primary action.
 
**Use Pattern 1 for inline/secondary CTAs and Pattern 2 for the primary action of a screen.**
 
### Locked Preview Card Pattern
 
For showing auth-gated features to logged-out visitors:
 
- **Top:** Preview mockup area with `bg-hero-bg/50 backdrop-blur-[3px]` lock overlay. Lock icon only (no text).
- **Bottom:** Clear text area with icon (unique color per card) + title + description. Not behind blur.
- Border between areas: `border-b border-white/[0.06]`
 
### Section Dividers (Homepage)
 
Between every major homepage section:
 
```
<div className="border-t border-white/[0.08] max-w-6xl mx-auto" />
```
 
Content-width, not full-viewport. Subtle but visible. Daily Hub does NOT use these (the HorizonGlow continuous layer makes section boundaries invisible by design).
 
### Journey Section Squiggles
 
The homepage `JourneySection` uses narrow inline SVG squiggles (~150px wide column, centered) — NOT the full-width `BackgroundSquiggle` component. The SVG uses `preserveAspectRatio="none"` to stretch vertically and a gradient mask to fade at top/bottom. **This is the only remaining squiggle usage in the app** — squiggles were removed from Daily Hub in Wave 5 and from Music tabs (verify before redesign work).
 
### Sticky FAB Pattern (Wave 7)
 
Persistent floating action buttons that anchor to the bottom-right of the viewport with safe-area-inset support:
 
```tsx
<div
  className="pointer-events-none fixed z-40 transition-opacity duration-200"
  style={{
    bottom: 'max(1.5rem, env(safe-area-inset-bottom))',
    right: 'max(1.5rem, env(safe-area-inset-right))',
  }}
>
  <div className="pointer-events-auto">
    {/* Actual interactive content */}
  </div>
</div>
```
 
Key principles:
- `pointer-events-none` on the outer fixed div + `pointer-events-auto` on the inner so empty space around the FAB doesn't intercept clicks on underlying content
- `z-40` puts it above content but below modal overlays (which use `z-50`)
- `env(safe-area-inset-*)` respects iOS notches and Android navigation bars
- Drop shadow on the inner element (e.g., `shadow-[0_4px_20px_rgba(0,0,0,0.4)]`) lifts the FAB visually off the page
 
### Drawer-Aware Visibility Pattern (Wave 7)
 
Components that auto-hide when the AudioDrawer is open (chat-widget pattern). Used by `DailyAmbientPillFAB`:
 
```tsx
const audioState = useAudioState()
const isHidden = audioState.drawerOpen
 
return (
  <div
    className={cn(
      'fixed ... transition-opacity duration-200',
      isHidden ? 'opacity-0 pointer-events-none' : 'opacity-100',
    )}
    aria-hidden={isHidden}
  >
    {/* content */}
  </div>
)
```
 
This prevents the FAB from sitting on top of the AudioDrawer when it slides in. When the drawer closes, the FAB fades back in over 200ms.
 
### Inline Element Layout — Position Verification
 
When designing layouts with elements that should be inline (e.g., chips and pills on a single row, label and input on the same line), the visual verification step (`/verify-with-playwright`) should compare `boundingBox().y` values between elements — not just CSS classes. Two elements with correct `flex` classes can still wrap to different rows if their combined width exceeds the container. **A chip row with `flex-wrap` will silently wrap a trailing element to row 2, and CSS-only verification won't catch it.**
 
When specifying inline layouts, document the expected y-coordinate alignment in the spec/plan so verification has explicit positional assertions.

## Accessibility Patterns (BB-35)
 
BB-35 conducted a full accessibility audit and formalized the canonical patterns below. WCAG 2.2 AA is the project target. Lighthouse Accessibility score target is 95+ on every major page.
 
### Skip-to-main-content links
 
- Standard layout: the canonical skip link is mounted by `Navbar.tsx` as the first focusable element on the page. Visible only on keyboard focus. Jumps to the `<main>` element.
- BibleReader exception: because BibleReader uses `ReaderChrome` instead of `Navbar`, it mounts its own root-level skip link. The `ReaderChrome` toolbars are wrapped in `<nav aria-label="Reader controls">` so the skip link can bypass them.
- **Every page must have a skip link.** If a future page uses an alternative layout, it must mount its own skip link or include the canonical one.
 
### Heading hierarchy
 
- Every page must have exactly one `<h1>`. Visually-hidden h1s are acceptable for pages where the title appears in chrome rather than in body content (e.g., MyBiblePage uses a visually-hidden h1).
- Heading levels must be sequential (no `<h2>` followed by `<h4>` skipping `<h3>`).
- Section headings within a page use `<h2>` and `<h3>` consistently.
 
### ARIA patterns
 
- **Modals/dialogs:** `role="dialog"` + `aria-modal="true"` + labelled by a heading or `aria-label`. Use `useFocusTrap()` for focus management. Restore focus to the trigger on close.
- **Alert banners:** `role="alert"` + `aria-live="assertive"` for crisis content. `role="status"` + `aria-live="polite"` for non-critical announcements.
- **Toggle buttons:** `aria-pressed="true|false"` on toggles where the same button represents two states (mood selector buttons, sound effects toggle).
- **Icon-only buttons:** `aria-label` describing the action (e.g., "Close drawer", "Toggle audio"). Decorative icons inside labelled buttons get `aria-hidden="true"`.
- **Stat card icons:** Decorative icons in stat cards get `aria-hidden="true"` so screen readers don't read the icon name as part of the stat.
- **Form inputs:** Every input must have an associated `<label>` (via `htmlFor`/`id`) or `aria-label`. Placeholder text is not a label. Use `aria-invalid="true"` and `aria-describedby` for error messages.
- **Live regions:** Character count uses `aria-live="polite"` to announce zone changes (e.g., "approaching limit", "limit reached") without interrupting user typing.
 
### Color contrast
 
- All text on dark backgrounds must meet the contrast minimums in the "Text Opacity Standards" table above.
- Verify contrast with the canonical opacity values, not by eyeballing.
- When in doubt, use `text-white` — it always passes.
 
### Focus indicators
 
- Never use `outline-none` or `focus:outline-none` without a visible replacement.
- Use `focus:ring-2 focus:ring-white/50 focus:ring-offset-2 focus:ring-offset-hero-bg` or equivalent.
- The white pill primary CTA pattern includes the canonical focus ring already.
 
### Tab order
 
- Tab order must follow visual order (top-to-bottom, left-to-right within rows).
- The first focusable element on every page should typically be the skip-to-main-content link.
- Use `tabindex="0"` to add elements to the tab order; use `tabindex="-1"` to remove them. Never use `tabindex` values greater than 0.
 
### Reduced motion
 
- The global `prefers-reduced-motion` rule in `frontend/src/styles/animations.css` handles this site-wide. Individual components do not need to check.
- Documented exemptions: shimmer (300ms loading state), breathing exercise (functional), garden ambient SVG. See "Reduced-Motion Safety Net" section above.
 
### Accessibility statement page (`/accessibility`)
 
BB-35 added a public `/accessibility` page linked from the site footer. The page publishes:
 
- Worship Room's accessibility commitment
- The target standard (WCAG 2.2 AA)
- Known limitations (e.g., the BibleReader's reader-mode only theme switching, not site-wide)
- A feedback mechanism (email or form)
- The date of the last accessibility audit
 
Update the audit date when running the BB-35 protocol or any future accessibility-focused spec.

## Error UX Tier System

When handling errors in UI code, choose the appropriate tier based on user impact:

**Tier 1 — Inline error state with retry (for primary actions):**
Use when the error affects a core user action the user is actively trying to complete. The error state should replace the failed UI region with a clear explanation and a "Try again" button. Example: AI Explain/Reflect panels. The retry button should re-attempt the same operation without losing user context.

**Tier 2 — Fallback UI with alternative (for secondary content):**
Use when the error affects a secondary feature but the user has a way to continue. The fallback should acknowledge the failure briefly and point at the alternative. Example: Spotify embed falls back to a "Listen on Spotify" link. Map tile failure falls back to the list view.

**Tier 3 — Toast notification (for background operations):**
Use when the error affects a background operation that the user initiated but isn't actively watching. The toast should explain briefly and auto-dismiss after a few seconds. Don't use for errors during primary actions — those need Tier 1.

**Tier 4 — Silent fallback (for non-essential features):**
Use when the feature is truly non-essential and the error is expected/common. Example: localStorage quota exceeded during analytics write. The code should catch and swallow silently, but add a comment explaining why.

**When in doubt, escalate tiers rather than downgrade.** A user who sees a clear error message is better served than one who sees silent failure.

**Avoid:** Logging to console only without user-visible feedback for user-initiated actions. Users don't read the console.

## Known Issues
 
- **Footer touch targets**: Crisis resource links and App Store badges (40px) undersized on mobile (44px minimum). Pre-existing.
- **Spotify embed loading**: May show fallback in headless/restricted environments.
- **Audio cluster (BB-26 through BB-29, BB-44)**: Deferred pending FCBH API key. Will get a separate BB-37c audit when shipped — NOT a re-run of BB-37b.
