## Logging & Monitoring

### Structured Logging (Spring Boot)
- **Format:** JSON logs via Logback for machine parsing
- **Levels:** INFO (normal operations), WARN (degraded but recoverable), ERROR (failures requiring attention)
- **Every log entry includes:** timestamp, log level, logger name, request ID (from `X-Request-Id` header), user ID (if authenticated)
- **Action logging:** Log key user actions (post_created, comment_added, friend_request_sent, report_filed) at INFO level with action name + metadata
- **Error logging:** Log full exception + stack trace + request ID at ERROR level for server-side debugging

### PII Handling (CRITICAL)
- **Never log in application logs:** user input text (posts, comments, journal content, prayer text, verse text bodies sent to the AI proxy), email addresses, passwords or tokens, or LLM response bodies (AI-generated explanations, reflections, prompts, insights).
- **Safe to log:** user UUIDs, timestamps, action names, content IDs, mood values (numeric), Bible references like "John 3:16" (citations, not content), error codes, HTTP status codes, request body lengths (as counts, not contents).
- **AI proxy logging discipline:** Controllers log the reference (e.g., `"John 3:16"`) and `verseTextLength` (a number). They NEVER log `verseText`, the generated `content`, or any part of the LLM response body. `GeminiController` (Spec 2) is the canonical example: `log.info("Explain request received reference={} verseTextLength={}", reference, verseText.length())`.
- **IP addresses:** Used transiently for rate limiting. NOT persisted in the database. The narrow exception is rate-limit-diagnostic INFO logs (`log.info("Rate limit hit for ip={} ...")` in `RateLimitFilter`) — these go to stdout for operational visibility and are acceptable because (a) the IP is already the rate-limit bucket key, (b) stdout logs are ephemeral, and (c) they are essential for diagnosing a 429 in production. The IP MUST still be stripped from any structured log fields that flow to Sentry, log aggregators, or long-term storage — the Sentry PII scrubber handles this (see below).
- **Admin audit log:** Stored in `admin_audit_log` table using admin_user_id (UUID only, no email).

### Framework Log Suppression (MANDATORY for proxy endpoints)

The PII rules above govern what **our own code** logs. Spring's built-in request-processing loggers at DEBUG level emit their own messages that include deserialized request bodies via each record's default `toString()`, AND Spring's `WebClient` at DEBUG level emits outbound HTTP URLs including query strings — both of which defeat controller-level discipline. For proxy endpoints whose DTOs contain user-submitted content (verse text, journal entries, place queries, Bible ids with query params, etc.) OR whose outbound calls pass API keys via `?key=...` query string (FCBH DBP, Google Maps), this is a back-door PII / secret leak even when the controller only logs safe fields.

**Prod profile is already safe** — `logging.level.org.springframework.web=WARN` suppresses DEBUG body-processor and ExchangeFunctions chatter entirely. **Dev profile must suppress it explicitly**, because dev sets `logging.level.org.springframework.web=DEBUG` for useful framework diagnostics (mapping lookups, handler discovery, response status) which collaterally re-enables body logging AND outbound URL logging.

**Required additions to `backend/src/main/resources/application-dev.properties`:**

```properties
# (1) Suppress Spring's body-processor DEBUG output so request-body records' toString()
# representations (which contain user content like verseText) don't leak into application logs.
# Required by 07-logging-monitoring.md § Framework Log Suppression — the PII rule is absolute,
# not prod-only. Keeping other org.springframework.web DEBUG output useful.
logging.level.org.springframework.web.servlet.mvc.method.annotation=INFO

# (2) Suppress Spring WebClient's ExchangeFunctions DEBUG output so outbound HTTP URLs
# (which contain API keys for upstreams that accept keys via query string — FCBH, Google Maps)
# don't leak into application logs. Added during Spec 4 (ai-proxy-fcbh) Deviation #1 after a
# `grep -iE 'aiza|key='` check of dev-profile stdout surfaced the keys in plain text. Applies
# retroactively to Spec 3 Maps as well. Narrow class-level target keeps response-status,
# timing, and retry diagnostics on reactive.function.client at DEBUG.
logging.level.org.springframework.web.reactive.function.client.ExchangeFunctions=INFO
```

**Why narrow package targeting matters:** The body-processor (`RequestResponseBodyMethodProcessor`) lives at `...mvc.method.annotation`; the outbound URL logger lives at `...reactive.function.client.ExchangeFunctions`. Suppressing only these two specific classes keeps mapping / handler / view-resolution / response-status / WebClient-retry DEBUG intact, which is useful during local dev.

**Rule for new proxy specs:** Any time a new proxy spec adds a DTO record containing user-submitted content OR adds outbound WebClient calls that pass secrets via URL (query string or path), the two dev-profile suppressions above apply automatically — no per-endpoint action needed. What IS required: do not override either `logging.level` key back to DEBUG in any profile-specific or local-override properties file — that re-opens the leak. For specs that introduce new upstream loggers (e.g., `reactor.netty.http.client` if reactive logging changes upstream versions), extend this section with a new suppression line keyed to the same PII / secret-leak principle.

**Verification during end-to-end smoke for any proxy spec:** After a happy-path request, run:

```bash
grep -iE 'aiza|key=|signature=' /path/to/backend.log | wc -l
```

Expect `0`. If any match, the suppression isn't working. Also grep the backend log for the user-content fields of your DTO; if any match, the body-processor suppression (line 1 above) isn't working either. Also verify the controller-level INFO log (with the safe-to-log fields like `reference` and `verseTextLength`) still appears — if it's gone, you've suppressed too broadly.

### Error Tracking — Sentry (Spec 1.10d, BACKEND ONLY)
- **Platform:** Sentry. Backend wired in Spec 1.10d via `sentry-spring-boot-starter-jakarta`. Frontend Sentry deferred to a follow-up spec (1.10d-bis when scoped).
- **DSN-absent posture:** SDK is a graceful no-op when `SENTRY_DSN` is unset. Dev runs and test runs ship zero events. Prod ships only when explicitly wired through Railway Variables.
- **Configuration:** `backend/src/main/java/com/worshiproom/config/SentryConfig.java` is the single config class. Two beans: `BeforeSendCallback` (drops expected exceptions; see below) and `SentryUserContextFilter` (attaches `user.id` to scope; see below). Sample rates pinned: `sample-rate=1.0`, `traces-sample-rate=0.0`. APM / tracing is its own future spec.
- **PII boundary (HARD RULE):** the only field attached to any Sentry event is `user.id` (UUID). Email, displayName, IP, and any request-body content are NEVER attached. `sentry.send-default-pii=false` in `application.properties` disables Sentry's default PII auto-attachment (which would include request bodies and headers). The user-context filter reads `AuthenticatedUser` from `SecurityContextHolder` and copies ONLY the UUID — it deliberately ignores the `isAdmin` flag also exposed by the principal.
- **Expected-vs-unexpected boundary:** the canonical list is `SentryConfig.EXPECTED_EXCEPTIONS`. Auth failures, validation errors, rate limits, upstream errors, safety blocks, and FCBH not-founds are dropped before reaching Sentry — every one of them maps to a row in `backend/docs/api-error-codes.md` and is "expected behavior" rather than a system fault. Everything else (the catch-all `ProxyExceptionHandler.handleUnexpected` path, anything that escapes a handler entirely, anything thrown from a filter not already in the expected set) reaches Sentry. The filter walks the cause chain: a `RuntimeException` whose `getCause()` is one of the expected types is also dropped. Updating the set requires code review per spec § 4.4 — NOT env-var-tunable.
- **Logback ingestion DELIBERATELY DISABLED.** Sentry's Logback appender is NOT registered. The Spring starter's `@ExceptionHandler` integration already captures every exception; adding the Logback path would double-count. Do NOT enable without first removing the starter's auto-capture.
- **CSP impact:** none. Backend SDK fires server-side from the JVM; the browser CSP `connect-src` directive does not need a Sentry origin. Frontend Sentry (when 1.10d-bis ships) WILL need a CSP loosening — that's a follow-up concern.
- **Operator runbook:** `backend/docs/runbook-monitoring.md` covers account setup, DSN extraction, Railway wiring, alert triage, and the UptimeRobot procedure (documented but not yet configured).
- **Env vars:** `SENTRY_DSN` (secret, optional everywhere — empty = graceful no-op) and `SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT` (config, optional — recommended in prod for Sentry UI filtering). See `backend/docs/env-vars-runbook.md` § 3.6.
- **DSN:** Via `SENTRY_DSN` env var (empty = disabled).
- **Environment tagging:** `SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT=development|staging|production`.

### Uptime Monitoring (Spec 1.10d)
- **Platform:** UptimeRobot (or Better Stack)
- **Monitored endpoint:** `GET /api/v1/health` — returns 200 when app is healthy
- **Health check includes:** database connectivity, Redis connectivity (if configured), disk space
- **Alert channel:** Email to `ADMIN_EMAIL` on downtime
- **Check interval:** Every 5 minutes

### Audit Logging
- **Admin/moderator actions:** ALL logged to `admin_audit_log` table
- **Fields:** admin_user_id, action (e.g., "deleted_post", "banned_user", "resolved_report"), target_type, target_id, details (JSONB), mandatory moderator_note (50+ chars for Spec 10.7b actions), created_at
- **Retention:** Indefinite (audit logs are never purged — they contain no user content, only action records)
- **Access:** Admin-only endpoint for viewing audit history

### Performance Monitoring (deferred)
- **APM dashboards** (Datadog, etc.): Deferred to future wave per Appendix D
- **Distributed tracing** (OpenTelemetry): Deferred to future wave
- **Log aggregation** (Loki, etc.): Deferred — stdout capture is MVP
- **Current MVP approach:** Sentry for errors + UptimeRobot for uptime + Spring Boot Actuator for basic metrics

### Request ID Propagation (MANDATORY)

Every request receives a 22-character base64 request ID via `RequestIdFilter` (Spec 1):
- Set as response header `X-Request-Id`
- Placed in SLF4J MDC under key `requestId` so every log line emitted during the request lifecycle includes it (plain text: `[%X{requestId:-no-req}]` prefix; JSON: dedicated `requestId` field via `logstash-logback-encoder`)
- Cleared in a `finally` block after the filter chain completes so MDC doesn't leak across requests in the thread pool
- If the client sends their own `X-Request-Id` header (≤64 chars), the server honors it for end-to-end tracing; otherwise it generates a fresh ID

All error responses include the same `requestId` value inside the `ProxyError` body, so a user reporting a failure can quote the ID and the operator can `grep` backend logs for that string to retrieve the full server-side context. This is the primary debugging workflow — do not break it by introducing log statements that omit the MDC prefix or code paths that skip `RequestIdFilter`.

### Spring Boot Actuator
- **Enabled endpoints:** `/actuator/health`, `/actuator/info`, `/actuator/metrics`
- **Secured:** Actuator endpoints require admin auth in production (public in dev)
- **Health indicators:** Database, Redis, disk space
