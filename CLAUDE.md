# Worship Room - Project Guide

## Project Overview

**Worship Room** is a Christian emotional healing and worship web application (with native mobile apps on the roadmap) that provides a safe, peaceful online space where users can find comfort, guidance, and spiritual support through AI-powered scripture matching, prayer generation, journaling, audio content, community support, worship music, and personal growth tracking.

### Mission

Create an accessible platform where anyone (especially Christians) can find emotional healing through worship, scripture, prayer, community support, and measurable spiritual growth.

## Implementation Details

**All technical standards, security policies, coding conventions, design system details, UX flows, and component architecture are in `.claude/rules/`. Read the relevant rule file before implementing any feature.**

- 🚨 **[AI Safety & Ethics](.claude/rules/01-ai-safety.md)** - Crisis detection, content boundaries, moderation
- 🔒 **[Security](.claude/rules/02-security.md)** - Auth, rate limiting, encryption, input validation, auth gating strategy, demo mode data policy
- ⚙️ **[Backend Standards](.claude/rules/03-backend-standards.md)** - Spring Boot conventions, API contract
- 🎨 **[Frontend Standards](.claude/rules/04-frontend-standards.md)** - React patterns, accessibility, responsive design
- 🗄️ **[Database](.claude/rules/05-database.md)** - Schema, indexes, data retention
- ✅ **[Testing](.claude/rules/06-testing.md)** - Testing strategy, coverage requirements, definition of done
- 📊 **[Logging & Monitoring](.claude/rules/07-logging-monitoring.md)** - Structured logging, PII handling
- 🚀 **[Deployment](.claude/rules/08-deployment.md)** - Environment variables, deployment platforms, dev commands
- 🎨 **[Design System & Components](.claude/rules/09-design-system.md)** - Color palette, typography, component inventory, hooks, utilities, Music architecture

## Complete Feature List

Full launch targets a complete feature set; features may ship incrementally (alpha/beta) for early feedback.

**Prerequisites Cheatsheet** (build features in any order, just satisfy dependencies first):

- **AI features** require: safety checks + rate limiting + logging + backend crisis detection
- **Community features** (prayer wall) require: auth + moderation + admin audit log + email notifications
- **Analytics** require: mood tracking persisted to database (localStorage for frontend-first build)
- **Audio features** require: TTS API integration (OpenAI TTS or browser Speech Synthesis for MVP)
- **Email notifications** require: SMTP configured + failure handling
- **Data encryption** require: key management + env/secret manager
- **Dashboard & Growth features** require: mood check-in system + localStorage (frontend-first), API persistence in Phase 3+
- **Friends & Leaderboard** require: user auth + friend data model (mock data for frontend-first build)

**Non-Goals for MVP**: No multi-language, no payments, no OAuth (email/password only), no real-time chat, no Spotify OAuth, no complex user profiles, no multi-admin, no human-narrated audio (TTS only), no prayer groups, no church portal, no Apple Health/Google Fit, no standalone Listen page.

**Future Platform Goals** (post-MVP):

- **Native iOS & Android apps** — on the roadmap. Web app is the primary platform; native apps will add phone contacts friend discovery, push notifications, and native audio background playback. Architecture decisions should be made with native apps in mind (API-first data layer, platform-agnostic friend system).

**Key Decisions:**

- **Bible Translation**: WEB (World English Bible) — modern English, public domain, no licensing required
- **Spotify Integration**: No Spotify API required. Song of the Day embed uses track IDs from the Worship Room playlist (https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5Ux99VLE8cG7W656CjR2si). "Follow our playlist on Spotify" CTA links to this URL.
- **Gamification Philosophy**: "Gentle gamification" — celebrate presence, never punish absence. Framing is encouragement and growth, not competition or guilt. Mood data is always private; only engagement data (streaks, points, level) is visible to friends.

## Build Approach

### Spec-Driven Workflow

Use this workflow for all new features:

1. **`/spec <feature description>`** — Generates a spec file in `_specs/`, switches to a new feature branch
2. **`/plan _specs/<feature>.md`** — Reads spec, explores codebase, generates implementation plan in `_plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<feature>.md`
3. **Review** — User reviews and approves the plan before implementation begins
4. **`/execute-plan _plans/<plan>.md`** — Implements the feature step-by-step following the approved plan
5. **`/code-review`** — Runs accessibility + code quality review on uncommitted changes. Pass plan path for plan-aware review.
6. **`/verify-with-playwright`** — Visual verification of frontend changes using Playwright browser automation (rendering, interactions, responsive breakpoints, console errors)

### Development Strategy

1. **Build logged-out experience first** — All features work in "demo mode" without login. Prompt to create account when trying to save data. Implement AI safety from day one.
2. **Then add authentication and personalization** — Spring Security + JWT, data saving, protected routes, mood tracking.
3. **Dashboard & Growth features built frontend-first** — localStorage with mock data, same pattern as Music and Prayer Wall. Backend wiring in Phase 3+.

---

## Working Guidelines

- **AI Safety First** — Crisis detection mandatory, never replace professional help (see `01-ai-safety.md`)
- **Ask before coding** if requirements are unclear; **ask before commits** unless obvious completion point
- **Run tests automatically** after code changes; ensure tests pass before commits
- **Feature branches only** — never commit directly to main
- **Responsive + accessible** — test mobile/tablet/desktop; semantic HTML, ARIA labels, keyboard nav
- **Security** — never commit API keys, sanitize all input, validate everything
- **Empathy** — this app touches emotional/spiritual topics; approach with care and respect
- **Gentle gamification** — celebrate presence, never punish absence; frame everything as encouragement, not competition
- **Privacy by default** — mood data is always private; users control visibility of engagement data; provide full privacy controls
